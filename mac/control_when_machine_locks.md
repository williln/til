## Problem 

Related to [the issue with Slack kicking me out of huddles](https://github.com/williln/til/blob/main/slack/computer_locking_kicks_out_of_huddles.md), I decided to look up how sensitive my laptop is to inactivity. 

## Specs 

Macbook Pro M3 on Sonoma 14.3.1 

## System Settings > Lock Screen
