# Keep Slack from kicking you out of huddles when your machine locks 

## Problem 

I use the Slack Huddles feature a lot, and have had several instances where I was actively speaking to someone and partipating in the meeting, but I hadn't moved my mouse or touched anything in a while. My machine would lock up, and the huddle would cut out. I found the setting to fix it in Slack.
