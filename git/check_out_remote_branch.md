# Checking out someone else's branch 

## Use case 

A colleague has opened a PR. I want to check out their branch on my own machine so I can run it and test their changes 

## Instructions 

- Get the branch name that you want
- Back in your terminal, run `git fetch` to load all the remote branch
- Then run `git checkout <branch-name>`

Another "thing I have known for a while but sometimes forget."
