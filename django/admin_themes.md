# Themes for the Django Admin 

This was linked in today's Django News: [Django Admin Theme Roundup 2025](https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2025/apr/18/admin-theme-roundup/?utm_campaign=Django%2BNewsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Django_Newsletter_282). This post is basically just a link roundup of that post, but the post has screenshots and useful info. Go check it out. 

- [Dracula for the Django Admin](https://draculatheme.com/django-admin)
- [Django Daisy](https://hypy13.github.io/django-daisy-docs/), which uses Tailwind. Personal note: This one reminds me a little of a skin that a client has on their Neapolitan CRUD Views. White background, left-hand menus, etc.
- [Django Djazzmin](https://django-jazzmin.readthedocs.io/), which reminds me a little of [Toggl](https://track.toggl.com/).
- [Kubi](https://github.com/dengunorg/django-admin-kubi), which is in Bootstrap 5
- [Django JET Reboot](https://django-jet-reboot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [Django Semantic UI](https://globophobe.github.io/django-semantic-admin/), which looks a little like the Wagtail Admin
- [Simple UI](https://newpanjing.github.io/simpleui_docs/en/), very clean
- [Grapelli](https://grappelliproject.com/), with some drag-and-drop sorting capabilities
- [Django Admin Interface](https://github.com/fabiocaccamo/django-admin-interface), which is laid out like the Django Admin of today, but skinned more like the Django site and with color theming.
- [Unfold](https://unfoldadmin.com/), which uses Tailwind and looks really slick
